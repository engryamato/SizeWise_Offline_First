# Procedure: Sync MVP Decision (Documents Only)

## Steps
1. Decide: include minimal sync in MVP or de-scope to post-MVP
2. If in: finalize 05-sync-conflict-spec.md (endpoints, conflicts, queue semantics)
3. If out: mark sync features as future in Notion and 01-architecture.md

## Outputs
- Decision record and rationale
- If in-scope: initial API contract v0.1
